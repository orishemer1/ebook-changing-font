First, we find that rent control caused property values to fall by 6-7%, for an aggregate loss of $1.6 billion. Both owner-occupied and rental properties lost value, but the losses were larger for rental properties, and in neighborhoods with a higher concentration of rentals. Second, leveraging administrative parcel-level data, we find that the tenants who gained the most from rent control had higher incomes and were more likely to be white, while the owners who lost the most had lower incomes and were more likely to be minorities. For properties with high-income owners and low-income tenants, the transfer of wealth was close to zero. Thus, to the extent that rent control is intended to transfer wealth from high-income to low-income households, the realized impact of the law was the opposite of its intention.",73.0

Why lockdown a city for fear of a virus when more people are dying daily in car accidents? Our record on acting early isn’t great. Moreover, AI risk also has a strong chance of going viral.

It is a statement about bureaucratic rule, coercion, lies, fear, and mismanagement.  The problems were not new, nor were they unfamiliar.  Lack of transport, for instance, which was identified by nearly every front-line officer as the reason the retreat turned into a route that June, was a long-standing concern of units based along the Soviet border.  “It is absolutely unknown to us where and when we will receive the motorized transport we need for newly mobilized units”…Spare parts, fuel, and tires were impossible to guarantee.",90.0

1302,,"Merriweather, serif","The best estimates of a maximally accurate source would be very frequently updated and follow a random walk. And authoritative sources like WHO are often said to be our most accurate sources. Even so, such sources do not tend to act this way. They instead update their estimates rarely, and are especially reluctant to issue estimates that seem to “backtrack” on previous ones. Why?",92.0
1303,,"Merriweather, serif","First, authoritative sources serve as a coordination point for the behavior of others, and it is easier to coordinate when estimates change less often. Second, authoritative sources need to signal that they have power; they influence others far more than others influence them. Both of these pressures push them toward making infrequent changes. Ideally only one change, from “we don’t know”, to “here is the answer”. But if so, why do they feel pressures to issue estimates more often than this?",93.0
1304,,"Merriweather, serif","…authoritative sources prefer a strong consensus on what are the big sources of info that force them to update. This pushes for making very simple, stable, and clear distinctions between “scientific” info sources, on which one must update, and “unscientific” sources, where it is in considered inappropriate to update. Those latter sources must be declared not just less informative, but uninformative, and slandered in enough ways to make few tempted to rely on them.",94.0
1305,,"Merriweather, serif","Due to the third of these pressures, authoritative sources will work hard to prevent challengers competing on track record accuracy. Authorities will issue vague estimates that are hard to compare, prevent the collection of data that would support comparisons, and accuse challengers of crimes (e.g., moral positions) to make them seem ineligible for authority. And other kinds of powers, who prefer a single authority source they can defer to in order to avoid responsibility for their decisions, will help to suppress such competitors.",95.0

The number is absurdly low for a country with a workforce of 150 million. As a result, it can be years, even decades, before a high-skilled individual is granted a U.S. visa. Moreover, these 140,000 visas must also cover the spouse and unmarried children of the high-skilled worker, so the actual number of high-skilled workers admitted under these programs is less than half of the total. Perhaps most bizarrely there is a cap on the number of visas allowed per country regardless of population size.

1334,,"Merriweather, serif","This sounds convenient, and in many ways it will be. I’ll have more time for taking walks and reading books. But think through the broader equilibrium. If more emails are read by bots, then more emails will be written by bots.

In other cases, negotiators might insist on a face-to-face meeting, both to know they are getting “the real deal” and to limit the potential for back and forth. For some real-world interactions, online written communications will no longer be good enough.",126.0
1337,,"Merriweather, serif","Think about the college admissions essay, for example. Nowadays it is important.

First, during the Freeze, total retail sales in counties with TV access increased by 3–4% more on average than in counties without access. Second, the effect of TV was concentrated in the automobile sector, which alone accounted for a third of the total difference.",141.0

His books have been translated into more than a dozen languages. “In the establishment-skewering tradition of Voltaire, Cervantes and Jonathan Swift, we now have a new voice for our own digital age,” Newsweek raved in a review of Dan’s satirical novel, Options: The Secret Life of Steve Jobs, an international hit.

However, I replaced the desert with a flood on the horizon in these prints. There is beauty in the ways people adapt to live in demanding terrain, whether it be in proximity to oceans or deserts. Even though people are remarkably adaptive, the unpredictable impacts of climate change mean that many of those adaptive measures are not suited to protect from unexpected droughts, floods, and temperature swings. We have the means to adapt to the use of more renewable energy sources, which will mitigate climate change and be much less costly and chaotic than adapting to rising sea levels and rising temperatures. Let’s evolve and embrace the adaptive measures that make the most sense rather than burying our heads in the sand. A portion of the proceeds from this print will benefit to support its work to enhance environmental protections and combat climate change.

If he was still with us here in the land of the living, today would’ve been my Dad’s 78th Birthday. This photo, taken at the party after Harley’s baptism, perfectly sums up the dynamic of our relationship: we looked at stuff together in silence. Whether it was a George Carlin album as it spun on a record player or CARLIN AT CARNEGIE as it took over the TV in the early days of HBO, the time my Father and I spent together was always about watching stuff. And mostly, that stuff was movies.",

The movie rocked, of course – not just because it was Lucas and Spielberg at their best, but also because it was transgressive to be in the cinema at all when I was supposed to be learning about Christ. And my Father was not only not punishing me for lying to a grown-up, he was complicit as well! The next day, I tried to explain to my best friend Ernie O’Donnell two very controversial points I’d learned while studying a mid-afternoon movie instead of the Bible: 1) My Dad was cool, and 2) Indiana Jones was like an American James Bond.",

And as much as I’d always been a movie brat, that month was where my lifelong love affair with cinema began in earnest.

2899,431.0,"""PingFang TC"", ""Helvetica Neue"", Helvetica, STHeitiTC-Light, Arial, sans-serif",赫兹的离任，遗留下一个与国际标准融合的计划，该国际标准由国际会计准则理事会（IASB）制定，被美国外的大多数国家采用。而IASB的主席，大卫·特维迪爵士（右图）也将在2011年6月离职。尽管大卫爵士和赫兹即将双双离职，大型会计公司以及客户仍希望标准的融合能成为继任者的首要任务（原定2011年中期的最后期限就无所谓了）。,
2900,432.0,"""PingFang TC"", ""Helvetica Neue"", Helvetica, STHeitiTC-Light, Arial, sans-serif",计划中最具争议的问题是如何报告金融资产：以公允市价还是摊余成本。赫兹坚决支持公允市价，他认为用其他的方式将纵容金融欺诈。反对者认为，在市场崩溃时重新评估很少交易的资产，将更容易导致银行业危机，危机的后果也更加严重。其中一些反对者去年将赫兹拉到国会作证，导致公允市价一派的让步。但在近期的提案中，FASB再度强硬，要求大多数资产以公允市价报告。IASB采取了两分的方法，称持至到期的贷款和贷款等价物可以用摊余成本计算，而频繁交易的商品必须以市价计算。,
2901,433.0,"""PingFang TC"", ""Helvetica Neue"", Helvetica, STHeitiTC-Light, Arial, sans-serif",赫兹离开留下的空缺将由FASB的技术总监填补。新任代理主席莱斯丽·赛德曼本身就是一名理事。这意味着政策的连贯性。但2011年理事成员由5名扩大到7名，可能会产生巨大影响。赫兹打破了委员会中投票的二比二僵局，让报告标准的提案向公允市值严重倾斜。该提案目前正在征询公众意见，但外界更加青睐IASB的方案而非FASB的。会计公司中的“四大”（普华永道，安永，毕马威和德勤）以及要在国际上打交道的其他公司，都支持IASB。因此许多人认为，赫兹的离开，将让一个与外界能达成共识的人上位。,
2902,434.0,"""PingFang TC"", ""Helvetica Neue"", Helvetica, STHeitiTC-Light, Arial, sans-serif",与此同时，在IASB，小道消息称伊恩·麦金托什被内定为大卫爵士的接班人。虽然麦金托什是英国会计准则委员会主席，但他是新西兰人（欧陆人士不想再找个大卫爵士那样的英国佬了）。接任者人选将在年内公布。两个机构的接班人都急需外交才能。新任IASB主席需要讨好很多国家。而新任FASB主席不能再全面使用公允市值，则需要在这一问题上不失面子地让步。更困难的是，美国的新任标准制定者必须将美国这个世界最大的金融市场一点点推离本土制定的标准，推向世界标准。,

Like, okay, we need a button that logs the user into the server. Well, there’s, you know, a ton of ways that you can do that, but they’re very easy to iterate and try. I guess that’s the difference. With software, we can open up Photoshop and try 50 different approaches in, you know, half an hour.

And then it goes on to quality assurance. So it’s getting checked for minutes at a time, not just whether or not the crank moves, but that’s a big one. But every gap, we measure. Every millimeter along the edges of the device, we check for the amount of dots, we check for scratches. And each iteration of the different builds, we would have new things come up where sometimes the crank would sag, and before it never did that, or we would have a gap at the screen and it would never do that before.

A lot of it’s been stuff like that, where everybody touches something in one way or another. It definitely has evolved over time from the first sort of implementations where Dave figured out how to get a picture showing on the screen. I’d say it’s grown sort of in conjunction with the Season One games. So it was a good sort of feedback loop. As we were working on the Playdate OS, games were being developed for it. Either the Season One games, or just folks in the Playdate Developer Preview who had been working on games for awhile. So as people worked on games, it allowed us to develop the SDK sort of in a very focused way. People making the games, you know, asked us if there was a way to do something and we thought, ‘Oh, it would be good if we provided a way to do that, instead of making every game implement that thing on its own.’ One example would be the pathfinding algorithm. There was one game that needed it, and they were going to implement their own solution in Lua. But at the time I thought, ‘Oh, well, I’ll just do a C implementation because pathfinding is sort of a common thing for game developers to need. So, might as well build it into the firmware, make it faster for that developer, and available for all developers. And I think there were a lot of situations where things like that happened.

So a big focus for me was that this is a device that gets you to playing the next game that you want to play, and kind of stays out of your way. Now, when I say it stays out of your way, that doesn’t mean that it’s dry and has no personality. You know, there are times when you have to use the OS, you have to connect to WiFi, you have to change something in Settings.You have to choose the game that you’re going to play or install. So we tried to make that part fun. One thing is we have that crank and so, it’s not so much that we use it a lot in the OS, but a lot of ideas around how the OS is designed were made so as to, kind of, speak to the crank.”",

So I try to instead have lists of things that scroll up and down. So the main launcher where you find, you know, all of your games, is this like linear list that you’re scrolling through of the games, and you can use the crank to scroll through it. Every game’s launcher art—you know, think of that as like the icon on your phone—can be animated. So when you’re on it, it can be animated. When you launch the app, there can be like an animation into the app and, you know, and the sound follows it. So, ideally each game’s personality is there when you’re about to launch that game, or when you’re going through the games, checking them out one by one. That is where I hope people spend 99% of their time on their Playdate, not changing their WiFi password. And that is where I like having each game provide its own stamp of personality.”",

You have the Settings app, which is kind of a bunch of, like, tables of text, where you change what kind of clock you want to see and you know, your WiFi network password, so the thing with the Settings app and the Menu is that they’re quite simple, and they don’t waste your time. That’s something that’s important to me, that when you’re trying to change your WiFi password, you are not being kind of sidetracked by a bunch of goofy animations, when you’re just trying to do this administrative task. That doesn’t mean that they have like no flavor whatsoever. For instance, when you launch the Settings app, it shows this little animation. You know, it goes from the launcher art to the app. That’s just because that launch takes some number of milliseconds to happen anyway, we might as well show you, you know, an animation, same thing with the Menu button.

And finally we did, in fact, get to quarantine together in a small gray room run by the Malaysian government. But on the other side, we were finally able to get out to Penang, out to the factory, and there was a lot of movement control. We had to go to the police station regularly and get approval. We had roadblocks where we couldn’t pass between different areas, which was problematic for the whole process of vetting vendors, because there’s a vendor who’s supposed to make the screws and we can’t go and visit their factory and see what their quality is like.

And it would be easier if we had a clear forecast for how many Playdates to build, but we still have no idea how many customers out there want a Playdate. And so that’s made it really difficult to plan ahead, which is why the pre-orders are so important for us to figure out actually how many people want this. We did have to raise the price a little bit on Playdate, to make up for some of the cost increases that have taken place over the past year. Some of our parts have gone up by 20 or 30%, which is a pretty good increase. But also because of the part shortage, there’s sometimes an opportunity for us to get parts faster. If we offer more for them, say if a part is $3 and we can’t get it, we could say, ‘well, if we pay $4.50 for it, can we get them any sooner?’ And sometimes we can.

And our budgets aren’t super massive. Do you want to make a game for a device?’ Fortunately the cool thing about creative people and game developers is that, there’s definitely a group of people that just super resonated with that batch of ideas. One of the mistakes we made in marketing was leading with the big names and setting this impression that, like, here’s another device for that same club of indie developers that are successful, and that you’ve heard of, which is really not what we wanted at all. But, you know, marketing brain says, ‘oh man, you gotta get people excited about this thing.’ And you know, we got to use the big names and I think that set the wrong impression. And so we worked to correct that. That, like, early announcement really was beneficial for us, because it let us learn a lot of things, without selling the product yet. And it gave us an opportunity to correct a lot of things without selling the product yet. And I’m really, really, really grateful that we did that. So that allowed us to sit down and say, ‘Okay, the whole goal of this thing is that it’s for everybody. That you can get the development kit without having to pay a bunch of money, that every unit is a dev unit, that you don’t have to have special hardware to make a game for Playdate.’ We’re clearly trying to build something that is open and accessible, but the season needs to reflect that, too.

You can say, ‘well, too bad,’ or you can step back and say, ‘Oh, huh. Yeah, that’s right. I didn’t really think about that, and we will work on that.’ So we definitely took a step back and shored that up and reached out to more people and more developers and I think made the product and the season significantly better as a result.”",

But you can make a classic game where you’re, like, exploring a village or some dungeons or a house or something like that. Pulp is something you can use without ever writing a line of code. You can basically draw your art in it. You can lay out these like rooms or environments. You can put down characters, draw those, you can write what dialogue they say. All of that can be done without any code. However, if you’re interested in learning a little bit of scripting code, Pulp also supports something called Pulp Script, where you can have those simple programming solutions. Like if my character has a sword, then they can defeat the dragon at the end, and so on. It really is not very demanding in terms of the hardware that you run it on. The game that you’re working on is saved to your account, on our servers. So you can just come back to it another time, or, you know, another computer and pick up where you left off. And, when you’re done with this game, you can just download a .pdx file— that’s the executable game file for a Playdate—connect your Playdate via USB, and just move this file over. And you’ve got your game made in Pulp, in a web browser, playing on your Playdate. You can send this file to your friends and they can play it on their Playdates. So, in that sense, you can go from, you know, in front of a web browser on your computer to playing a game on your Playdate in minutes. I don’t know if there’s another thing like this for, you know, handheld consoles out there.

So we didn’t think that like a kind of a case that fully encloses it would really work well. We were thinking about other ideas. And so we were thinking about the axes along which you can put some sort of protective layer without, you know, blocking the crank or anything. And then,we started thinking about basically like about like a book jacket, you know? So the way that this Playdate cover works is, imagine sort of like a book. Turn it sideways so that it closes top to bottom. It clicks onto the back of the Playdate. It clicks magnetically, by the way, in these like, corner screw holes on the Playdate. And then it sort of folds over the top and it then closes it, you know, from the back to the front, kind of like a book closing.

So the idea was that if you want a slightly thicker Playdate on the go, you can snap on the speaker. And then if you want a very thick Playdate/one that also can sit on your desk, you can also snap on a battery pack. You can see that in the design today, where we kept the seam between the two units. ‘Cause we thought it looked kind of visually interesting. But in getting into the realities of that point, that was a lot going on at once. With the Playdate stereo dock, it was difficult to engineer something that was all of these separate pieces. And so at some point we said, okay, let’s make this one piece. And then we said, and well, let’s probably remove the battery because we don’t need that anymore because it’s now going to be just sitting on the desk. The Playdate stereo dock is awesome, because it provides a cool home for the Playdate. That’s my favorite thing about it.

It can be monotonous activity such as getting groceries, but if we can somehow spin it into an adventure…I’m in. So you can imagine my delight when I park on a random street in the East Village and see a sign that says, “Village Ice Cream, this way”…I followed, and another block see another sign, and on and on. Seriously I followed the street signs for 3 blocks and when I entered the fantastic and charming little store announced, “I followed the signs!!!”",

4982,1031.0,"Georgia, ""Times New Roman"", Times, serif","It really is the best ice cream I’ve ever had. That’s a pretty big statement right? Billy taught me all about High Fat/Low Sugar ice cream, which is exactly the opposite of what one may think is a)healthy, or b)yummy. Not true. This ice cream is rich before sweet and the details and subtleties of the flavors are evident. Billy was telling me that dairy is the expensive part of ice cream, so manufacturers in commercial ice cream are continually decreasing the amount of dairy fat and instead are filling it with all sorts of non-food things we shouldn’t be consuming: polysorbate, monodiglycerides…gross stuff. Billy uses recipes that are 100 years old and only the finest ingredients (organic pecans from California, he knows the grower personally), coffee beans from our very own Phil and Sebastian, etc.",

I cook this way in my regular life and I want my kids growing up knowing that carrots taste great with a little dirt on them and raspberries in season are better than any processed anything they will ever eat. However, I’m working a few contracts downtown right now and realistically I’m spending a lot more time booking dinner reservations and mixing drinks. Time to embrace it on the blog. So perhaps some recipes will be happily interspersed, but for now, you get Calgary foodie reviews, where to go, what to eat etc. It’s gonna be fun.",
4995,1044.0,"Georgia, ""Times New Roman"", Times, serif","Which brings me to this week’s adventurous night out…For those of you who know Calgary, you may remember about 10 years ago when 17th Ave was the. place. to. be. It kind of disappeared for a while but in the last few years some incredible places have opened up: Una Pizza and Wine, Ox & Angela, Chilitos Taco House, Cibo, 80th & Ivy, just to name a few. We went, this week, to National, which has been open for a few months. I’ve been a couple of times with “the girls”, but Sexy Husband and I thought we would check it out and actually eat something.
National is set up like a German Beer House, with long communal picnic tables, a huge patio, and a stock exchange style screen of the 100+ beers you can try. As people order a beer, it moves up on the screen in popularity. So fun. We met some friends and shared about 100 oysters (by we I do not mean me, because of an inconvenient shellfish allergy). Then we had a green salad, which was served in a mixing bowl large enough to feed the table. It had some great and surprising tastes including toasted walnuts and thinly shaved fennel with a really light buttermilk dressing. Delish. Then we got some deep fried pickles. Why oh why do I have to love deep fried pickles so much. And we topped things off with their classic poutine. It was a) an enormous portion, perfect for sharing, and b) the best chicken gravy I’ve ever tasted. Loved it. Other people ordered burgers and fish tacos, all which looked delicious. We finished the night with deep friend mars bars. They were yummy but pretty tiny and I’ve made better ones at home.",
4996,1045.0,"Georgia, ""Times New Roman"", Times, serif","All in all I was really impressed with the food. The environment is great too and the patio is huge. Our server was great and always showed up at the right time. The music was so loud that it made it hard to talk, but I’m adding National to my regular stops!",

Full of life, full of questions, full of jokes, full of attitude, small, beautiful humans. Since the first moment I walked outside the hospital with little Picky Princess, people have crossed the street to tell me what a beautiful child she is. And while I see what they do in her magical face, the things I find so beautiful about her are the things that come with 6 years of observation. I think the one freckle so perfectly placed under her right eye is so beautiful. I love that she is a wild mess most of the time, crazy haired and rainbow clad. I love how her pristine face stands out as a pocket of white paint on a graffiti’d canvas. I love the moments when she laughs for real. In those moments I find her too beautiful to look directly at. When she sleeps I can hardly tear my eyes away from her little face. It’s so white it glows.",
5002,1051.0,"Georgia, ""Times New Roman"", Times, serif","It’s also interesting to me how a child, particularly a girl, processes all this attention. With a big wide world telling her she is so beautiful, she definitely has come to agree. She is quick to comment on being beautiful, yet doesn’t necessarily seem to place a lot of value on it. She will say, Of course I’m beautiful, with the same matter of fact tone of, Of course my socks are blue. She doesn’t seek to enhance it with tiaras and make up and princess dresses. At least not very often.",
5003,1052.0,"Georgia, ""Times New Roman"", Times, serif","It’s important, how little girls wade through the beauty topic. It’s important what she sees in the women around her. For every comment I hear someone make to her about her beautiful blue eyes, I try to make my own to her about her incredible creativity, her kindness to her little sister, her willingness to help. The things that make her a Beautiful Soul, not just a Beautiful Face. I think my friends are some of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen. But even in how I talk about them to my girls, I try to comment on their beautiful character, that they are great listeners and generous friends.",

She has requested sea bass(of course, most random request ever) and caramel cake. So we have fish tacos, salsa verde, watermelon and caramel cake on the menu.

It’s therapy to him, he’s the cleanest most organized man alive. Or perhaps it’s pure shock when I suggest such a thing because I’m a little bit oblivious. I like it clean. I like it tidy. But I also don’t seem to notice things like the laundry basket overflowing, and honestly I don’t even know WHERE he takes the recycling to. But it’s true, there is something therapeutic about reordering closets, removing clutter, examining processes and finding ways to move through our very full lives smoothly and with as little tripping up as possible.",
5020,1069.0,"Georgia, ""Times New Roman"", Times, serif","This week, however, we thought we’d do a little INSIDE spring cleaning. We had a weekend of total indulgence. Sexy Husband wanted pub food for date night, and while I initially thought…ugh, I happily dove into the pulled pork and caramelized onion poutine and peanut buster parfaits of the evening. It tasted great. For 3 minutes. The over indulgence coupled with the realization that my jeans aren’t doing up quite as easily led to a conversation where we decided it was time to refocus on the food we put in our bodies and how much control we have over our health. Here we have all this knowledge and all these resources and even a little bit of talent when it comes to kitcheny things…there really is no excuse for tight jeans and gut rot.

She was (rightly) horrified. And determined that she MUST do something to save the lemurs. I told her I would help her in any way and to let me know how she thought we could save them.

Something about Christmas seems to make even the least kitcheny person a little bit more likely to bust out a rolling pin or cookie cutters. I learned a really brilliant lesson this Christmas Cookie Exchange Season, in fact I’m relieved to be learning this now in my early 30s. Ready? Cookie bars. This is the answer to parties where you need to have 9 dozen cookies perfectly packaged. It’s not the mixing that takes long, nor the actual baking time. It’s the rolling/cutting/or even dropping a zillion evenly placed cookies onto rotating baking sheets, parchment, silpat and the like. Cookie bars solve all this. Mix, bake, cut, give.

I was just there to watch a show Sexy Husband sang in and…she made it again! It brought back the happiest most nostalgic memories, even though I’ve made them myself every winter. Something about Gail making them, reminded me of cold COLD winters in Saskatchewan, surrounded by the warmest people I’ve ever met. I can’t actually find the original recipe she gave me, but it’s one that I can make in my sleep because it’s THAT GOOD.

5133,1182.0,Times,"Yesterdays post on crafting with kids reminded me that I’ve not yet shared the Kids Craft feature that I shot with Dan Duchars for Australian Country Style at the end of last year. Such a fun feature to work on and so lovely to still be able to work for Australian Country Style despite being back on home soil now (oh and a big thanks to Master Frith, my mini model for the day!) ",
5134,1183.0,Times,"It may or may not surprise you to know that although Albie is only just 7 months old I’ve already started dreaming up what I’ll do for his 1st Birthday party, I’ve not quite got to the mood-boarding stage…but it won’t be long! I know I shouldn’t be wishing the time away, and trust me I’m not,  I’m already beginning to realise that they are only “babies” for such a short amount of time. However I’m really, REALLY looking forward to when I can make stuff for / with Albie. I have such fond memories of the Barbie houses from cardboard boxes that my mum made for me as a child and I can’t wait to do the same with Albie {well maybe not Barbie houses…or maybe, who knows!} Any way I discovered this lovely little shoot from Knot magazine a little while back and popped it in my “things to do with the baby” folder…",
5135,1184.0,Times,"How cute!!! Love those little wings. If you’ve not seen Knot before, take a peek, page upon page of inspired loveliness, My French isn’t up to much so no idea what it say’s but beautiful images , projects and styling. I can only find two issues, both from last year, so I can only assume they didn’t continue with it, which is a real shame.",

5137,1186.0,Times,"In our last house we neglected lighting a little, we had some great lamps but pendant lights passed us by and we just went for simple drum shades, almost as an after thought. In this house I’m giving the main ceiling lights far more attention.  I’m on the hunt for a pendant for the Office / Playroom.  Ceiling height is limited so as we’ve done in both the Living Room and Albie’s Room I’ll probably have central pendant fitting that is looped to a hook in the corner. Teamed with lamps it works well and means I don’t have to go for a ridiculously short flex to avoid tall folk {like the husband!} constantly having to dodge the light fittings! I’m after something simple yet beautiful and made from a natural material, here’s some lovely light inspiration…",

5141,1190.0,Times,"Next project here at the House is what was once ear-marked as my office. The new addition to the household has made me re- consider plans for the space.  Having finally given to brightly coloured plastic toys  the Living Room is slowly starting to look like Toys R Us so I’ve decided my office space needs to double up as a play room…with hidden storage!  Until the top floor of the house is finished {several years away I’d imagine} from time to time it may have to work as a guest room too. Its a big ask for a small space. So I’ve re- jigged the original moodboard a bit on account that maybe it wasn’t fun enough!  Finding that contrast between fun  playroom, grown up guest room and inspiring office/craft space  it tricky, it is also off of the living room and the door will mostly be open so needs to work with the scheme in there too. We’ve decided to go for one wall as a giant chalk board so we can draw fun things for Albie , use it as a mood board for my work but so that it can be pared back if we have guests to stay. We are also hoping to do something a bit clever with a wall of cupboards that will house a fold-away desk plus Albie’s ever increasing collection of plastic. So now the tricky bit, I’ve narrowed it down to these two wallpapers….Louise Body’s Garden Birds and Ferm Living’s  Half Moon, I’m torn! Would love to know what you think…",

5143,1192.0,Times,Plasterer is coming on Thursday…cant wait!,
5144,1193.0,Times,"Since buying our house last year It’s been a bit of a running joke with my family & friends that it’s the Grey House. Every time somebody would ask what color am I going to paint that wall?, What’s the new front door colour going to be? How about the nursery? the reply was generally… Grey! Albie was even referred to as the “Grey Baby” before he arrived on account of the fact we didn’t know if he was going to be either “pink or blue” and even if we had of known his room certainly wouldn’t have been either pink or blue….it was grey!",
5145,1194.0,Times,"So It’s fair to say I like a bit of grey. Some might argue not a colour, more a tone, but nether the less finding the right grey is tricky, as I discovered when choosing “the grey” for the paintwork in our Living room. Grey are often too blue or too brown. So imagine my joy last week when a little parcel landed on my door mat, a brand spanking new paint chart (oh how I love a paint chart) simply of  full of Greys from those lovely folk over at Little Greene. The collection embraces shades of grey from almost white tones through to rich charcoal, brown and blue-black hues.",

5148,1197.0,Times,I love the styling in these shots. How great does the ombre bookcase look? and I love the double skirting and the hit of yellow on the steps.  I think my favourite grey is the panelled wall  (Scree 227) in the Bedroom shot ( also loving the Rowen & Wren Trestle table in that shot too),
5149,1198.0,Times,"I’m a country girl at heart. I’ve always loved the city but home to me will always be in the countryside, largely I think because I’m a sucker for nature. When I was about 6 I started a nature club (think there was a membership of 3!) We had homemade cardboard badges fastened by a safety-pin stuck on with a plaster (crafty!) and we’d stomp around the old orchard behind mum and dads looking for bugs and flowers / weeds.  So you get me gist, I love a bit of  flora & fauna. So needless to say I absolutely love the work of Anne Ten Donkelaar who “preserves” unique little discoveries of nature that cross her path, a damaged butterfly, broken twig, a tangle of weeds……she puts them back together again in her own unique and totally brilliant way.",

And there was lots of portable MP3 playing competition (like the titular Nomad in “less space than a Nomad“), but the iPod was one of the first times Apple showed up and did what we now think of as their standard move — they made The Apple Version®. It was personal, well-designed, innovative, meaningful, the sum of which was more than specs and checklists. We (I? The industry?) needed that. I have fond memories of Dave (who now works on Playdate) reverse-engineering the iPod database storage format so that you could use Audion to load songs onto it.

Adventures and strange side projects, and just having total creative freedom without having to be beholden to anyone, or make a lot of sense, or justify everything. We can do whatever we want to do. And I feel like as Panic has lasted longer and longer, I have begun to appreciate that that’s really unique and rare, especially talking to other people at different companies.

And we sort of explain this idea of a gaming device and it changes and it does all this stuff, and they pretty much spent the entire meeting telling us not to do it, that it would be prohibitively expensive. You know, we’d be five million dollars in before we even had a prototype and the resources required will be massive. We’d need a huge team and somebody in the meeting is like, ‘Why would anyone even want this?’ And it was extremely demoralizing. It was one of the only times where I felt like this weird Steve Jobs part of my brain want to just like get up and leave in the middle of the meeting, which I’ve never done in my entire life. Of course, I didn’t, because I’m not that person, but it was just brutal. Now, I understand what they’re trying to say, because what we’re doing is crazy, I get it. You know, it’s like how people come to us and they’re like, ‘Hey, I have an idea for an app!’ and you have to be like ‘Ah, that’s a great idea, but there’s a lot of things to consider. It’s really hard and chances of success are really slim.’ We were those people saying, ‘hey, I think we have an idea for a hardware project,’ and they were the ones trying to be like, ‘you know, uhh, you guys gotta understand…’ but I think what they didn’t understand about us is, like, we’re trying to learn. Even if it ends up as a failure—which it still could!—what we’re trying to get out of the process is doing something new, and learning something. So that meeting ended horribly.

And it’s like the tiniest of things that you think are automatic are definitely not automatic. Way more so than I think for software, although software has the same problem. Like, okay, we need a button that logs the user into the server. Well, there’s, you know, a ton of ways that you can do that, but they’re very easy to iterate and try. I guess that’s the difference. With software, we can open up Photoshop and try 50 different approaches in, you know, half an hour. With hardware, if you’re thinking about the way the d-pad feels that’s the only way you can solve that, is to try to build things, and, you know, 3D-print things and laser cut things.

So things like pathfinding and collision detection and some fun stuff like blurring [1-bit] images, and that’s actually a good example of collaboration, because I think I did the first implementation of blurring and dithering, and then Dave came along after and did a bunch of optimizations to it to make it faster on the hardware. A lot of it’s been stuff like that, where everybody touches something in one way or another. It definitely has evolved over time from the first sort of implementations where Dave figured out how to get a picture showing on the screen. I’d say it’s grown sort of in conjunction with the Season One games. So it was a good sort of feedback loop. As we were working on the Playdate OS, games were being developed for it. Either the Season One games, or just folks in the Playdate Developer Preview who had been working on games for awhile. So as people worked on games, it allowed us to develop the SDK sort of in a very focused way. People making the games, you know, asked us if there was a way to do something and we thought, ‘Oh, it would be good if we provided a way to do that, instead of making every game implement that thing on its own.’ One example would be the pathfinding algorithm. There was one game that needed it, and they were going to implement their own solution in Lua. But at the time I thought, ‘Oh, well, I’ll just do a C implementation because pathfinding is sort of a common thing for game developers to need. So, might as well build it into the firmware, make it faster for that developer, and available for all developers. And I think there were a lot of situations where things like that happened. When developing the SDK, we have to do a lot of API design for that.”",

5448,289.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“One thing we realized early on and that we felt strongly about is that this is not like a smartphone,” Neven says. “It is not going to have a persistent status bar that shows you your WiFi network strength and such, because those are not as important in a device that, you know, you don’t use for a million things a day, you use it to play games. So a big focus for me was that this is a device that gets you to playing the next game that you want to play, and kind of stays out of your way. Now, when I say it stays out of your way, that doesn’t mean that it’s dry and has no personality. You know, there are times when you have to use the OS, you have to connect to WiFi, you have to change something in Settings.You have to choose the game that you’re going to play or install. So we tried to make that part fun. One thing is we have that crank and so, it’s not so much that we use it a lot in the OS, but a lot of ideas around how the OS is designed were made so as to, kind of, speak to the crank.”",

5450,291.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“I try to avoid having grids of buttons and things that look touchable,” Neven continues. “I mean, you know on some level that the Playdate does not have a touchscreen, but still your lizard brain wants to touch it. So I try to instead have lists of things that scroll up and down. So the main launcher where you find, you know, all of your games, is this like linear list that you’re scrolling through of the games, and you can use the crank to scroll through it. Every game’s launcher art—you know, think of that as like the icon on your phone—can be animated. So when you’re on it, it can be animated. When you launch the app, there can be like an animation into the app and, you know, and the sound follows it. So, ideally each game’s personality is there when you’re about to launch that game, or when you’re going through the games, checking them out one by one. That is where I hope people spend 99% of their time on their Playdate, not changing their WiFi password. And that is where I like having each game provide its own stamp of personality.”",
5451,292.0,"""Chrono Regular""",There are also some fantastic surprise animations in the OS that were created by a company called Chromosphere.,
5452,293.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“So with the Playdate OS, there’s not a lot of it, if that makes sense,” says Neven. “The main things that you will see as you use it are that launcher, where you see all your games and launch them. You have the Settings app, which is kind of a bunch of, like, tables of text, where you change what kind of clock you want to see and you know, your WiFi network password, so the thing with the Settings app and the Menu is that they’re quite simple, and they don’t waste your time. That’s something that’s important to me, that when you’re trying to change your WiFi password, you are not being kind of sidetracked by a bunch of goofy animations, when you’re just trying to do this administrative task. That doesn’t mean that they have like no flavor whatsoever. For instance, when you launch the Settings app, it shows this little animation. You know, it goes from the launcher art to the app. That’s just because that launch takes some number of milliseconds to happen anyway, we might as well show you, you know, an animation, same thing with the Menu button. Dan Messing did this really nice little swipe of that menu when it happens. That kind of stuff does feel like personality, and like a little bit of a vibe to Playdate.”",
5453,294.0,"""Chrono Regular""","Almost as important as the visual feedback you get from using the crank to scroll through games, are the system’s audio cues that provide user feedback for various inputs.

They’re also colors that most companies out there are, like, too cowardly to use in their branding. People move towards like blue, or red, you know, rather than, you know, purple or yellow or orange.

And then it started to get cleaner and it started getting cleaner and then it’s like everything’s a rectangle that’s white, or you know, everything has rounded corners and is silver, and that seems to be where most things are today. So I think we are really looking back at— I mean, God, even the original Sport Walkman! That yellow Sport Walkman is so good. Sony really were sort of the masters of creating that kind of stuff, but I feel like that’s sort of the era and that’s what we wanted to be, was something that felt fun and cute and cool, and did not take itself too seriously. Because it’s weird how we went from the iMac, which most definitely didn’t take itself seriously. I mean it was like, you know candy purple and then there was the blue Dalmatian one or whatever and there was like, I mean, even, God, is there a computer that could be goofier than that sunflower hinged lamp iMac with that goofy rounded base and all that?

Hmm. Weird.’ I remember not understanding anything about it. I remember asking like, ‘wait, so am I…what’s wrong with going to the store?’ And like other people at Panic having to like, explain to me how a pandemic works. Feel kind of dumb in retrospect. Just with every passing day, things got a little bit more unusual and one day we’re like, ‘boy, I don’t think we should be going to the office anymore.’ Everybody grabbed their machines and, you know, we’re all just a hundred percent working from home remotely, and you know, there’s good and bad, but like, I think if you had told me that, in the final mile of creating this thing, you’re going to have to switch to working remotely, my instinct would have been, ‘that is a horrible idea and it will lead to absolute disaster.’ Clearly I am wrong. I would have been wrong, because it has not been that bad. I think we learned that we can do this, that we can be apart from each other and still creating something together and it’s not quite the same, but functionally, we just kept cranking and making things and working through the process.

And the other thing was they required a two-week quarantine. Once you arrived, you had to stay in a hotel once you got there. And that just made us traveling there that much harder. Fortunately, our manufacturing consultant, Steven — he and his wife Jessica bravely and heroically decided to volunteer for this duty. That helped us out just tremendously.

And we don’t know where we’re going to be, and we don’t know what the food is going to be. So we packed a huge suitcase with provisions and gin, and we arrived at the hotel and all the staff were in hazmat suits, and we were being carted around in these different cohorts. And finally we did, in fact, get to quarantine together in a small gray room run by the Malaysian government. But on the other side, we were finally able to get out to Penang, out to the factory, and there was a lot of movement control. We had to go to the police station regularly and get approval. We had roadblocks where we couldn’t pass between different areas, which was problematic for the whole process of vetting vendors, because there’s a vendor who’s supposed to make the screws and we can’t go and visit their factory and see what their quality is like. And so everything ended up being a bit elongated in that way. Restaurants were closed. Grocery stores were accessible, but we had to only stay within a certain area, or the police would stop us.

And then there were so many things that layered up on top of that. Even them getting things from their suppliers.

So it just, anytime we’d had one of those iterations where we said, well, this isn’t quite right, let’s make a design change, instead of taking a week like it normally does, that might take three weeks. On the electrical components, I think by now everyone’s heard about the chip shortage. And those are standard chips. They’re being made and being supplied to many people around the world. That’s just one aspect of kind of, the supply chain. In that case, it still is an ongoing challenge.

They’re all difficult to come by now. All have lead times that stretch into the several, you know, six months, nine months sometimes. And so that’s been a real challenge. We have enough parts to build the first twenty- or thirty thousand Playdates. The tricky part is trying to build that twenty-thousand-and-first Playdate. That’s when we have to wait on some new parts to come in. And it would be easier if we had a clear forecast for how many Playdates to build, but we still have no idea how many customers out there want a Playdate. And so that’s made it really difficult to plan ahead, which is why the pre-orders are so important for us to figure out actually how many people want this. We did have to raise the price a little bit on Playdate, to make up for some of the cost increases that have taken place over the past year. Some of our parts have gone up by 20 or 30%, which is a pretty good increase. But also because of the part shortage, there’s sometimes an opportunity for us to get parts faster. If we offer more for them, say if a part is $3 and we can’t get it, we could say, ‘well, if we pay $4.50 for it, can we get them any sooner?’ And sometimes we can.

5492,333.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“And the funny thing to me is that we thought it would be a struggle to get 10 games made for this,” says Neven. “So we started working on some of our own games and very cautiously approaching some people about making them.

5497,338.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“Arisa came to us from Valve and she is our Developer Relations manager, meaning that she is in charge of communicating with all of our game developers about Playdate—what’s going on with us and finding out from our developers what they’re working on, what issues they’re having. And that’s key for a product like Playdate, because the 24 games that make up the season are really a huge part of the value of Playdate. And so we want to make sure those games are, are top notch and it’s a Arisa’s job to make sure that developers know what we’re doing and they’re informed about our schedule. So she’s on top of all that. And then also she’s taken on a bunch of other duties, like working on our warranty and our return policy. And it’s just been a huge help. She’s done a great job.”",

5499,340.0,"""Chrono Regular""","So, how did Panic find the developers whose games will be included in Season One?",
5500,341.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“We obviously knew there’s no way we’re going to be able to build all the games for this thing by ourselves,” says Cabel. “And so the first question we asked was, ‘who do we know that can make games?’ And fortunately our paths have crossed with many gamers over the years of Panic.”",
5501,342.0,"""Chrono Regular""","Fun fact: One of the weirder Panic overlaps was that we made t-shirts for the game Katamari Damacy. Years later, that connection led directly to its creator, Keita Takahashi, creating the game ‘Crankin’s Time Travel Adventure’ for Playdate Season One.",
5502,343.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“I think I remember us all sitting down and just writing on note cards, the names of basically every developer that we thought was doing cool work, or we thought could do cool work and, it was a lot of note cards,” says Cabel. “It was a difficult process, because then you have to approach them and be like, ‘Hey, here’s this thing from—it’s hardware, from a company that’s never made hardware before, with a season system that’s never been attempted before, and a crank that’s never existed before. And our budgets aren’t super massive. Do you want to make a game for a device?’ Fortunately the cool thing about creative people and game developers is that, there’s definitely a group of people that just super resonated with that batch of ideas. One of the mistakes we made in marketing was leading with the big names and setting this impression that, like, here’s another device for that same club of indie developers that are successful, and that you’ve heard of, which is really not what we wanted at all. But, you know, marketing brain says, ‘oh man, you gotta get people excited about this thing.’ And you know, we got to use the big names and I think that set the wrong impression. And so we worked to correct that. That, like, early announcement really was beneficial for us, because it let us learn a lot of things, without selling the product yet. And it gave us an opportunity to correct a lot of things without selling the product yet. And I’m really, really, really grateful that we did that. So that allowed us to sit down and say, ‘Okay, the whole goal of this thing is that it’s for everybody. That you can get the development kit without having to pay a bunch of money, that every unit is a dev unit, that you don’t have to have special hardware to make a game for Playdate.’ We’re clearly trying to build something that is open and accessible, but the season needs to reflect that, too. We can’t have a season that says, this is for you the folks you’ve heard of, but also say this is for everybody.”",
5503,344.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“And that was one of those times where, I mean—criticism. Nobody likes it, because it doesn’t feel good, but it comes from an important place and you have to listen to it because there’s a reason why people are saying, ‘Hey, this thing is, is… this doesn’t make me feel great.’ You can react to that in two ways. You can say, ‘well, too bad,’ or you can step back and say, ‘Oh, huh. Yeah, that’s right. I didn’t really think about that, and we will work on that.’ So we definitely took a step back and shored that up and reached out to more people and more developers and I think made the product and the season significantly better as a result.”",
5504,345.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“It’s been kind of like my personal goal to bring in more voices to the game industry and more diverse voices,” says Arisa. “And so working with Sweet Baby, having that opportunity to work with them, has been really rewarding. They believe it’s very important that we provide a way for people to get work on a project and get credited for it so that they can put it on their resume and find other work in the industry.”",
5505,346.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“Sweet Baby’s an incredible group of super-talented game makers,” says Cabel. “And we talked to them about making a game for Playdate, and they did. And then we talked about making more games for Playdate, because they have this incredible endeavor where they are connecting veteran developers with super talented developers that maybe don’t have credits yet, that don’t have the experience in a shipped game, but have incredible abilities and skills. And, like, that is such a hard barrier and you just, you need to be seen and you need to be taken seriously. And that’s really hard to do when you can’t say, ‘I shipped this.’ And so Sweet Baby’s awesome idea is to pair people up and have a combination of experience and new experiences. It’s so smart. It’s so cool. And so when they said, ‘Yeah, we would love to put some teams together to make even more games for Playdate,’ it was just a super no-brainer. I’m so glad to be working with them. And the stuff they put together is super inspirational for us. It makes us excited about the platform. Again, it’s just that great feedback loop of, like, happiness, which is the best case scenario for a collaboration.”",
5506,347.0,"""Chrono Regular""",Sweet Baby’s “Lost Your Marbles” is just one of twenty-four amazing games that will be included with Season One. You can see the full list of games on the Playdate website. ,

5508,349.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“The Playdate Developer Preview was a way for us to really accomplish two things,” explains Cabel. “One: get Playdate in the hands of brand-new developers who have not touched this platform before and see how it goes. What’s confusing? What was hard to set up? What do they need from our SDK? It’s just a fresh set of experiences. That in a way, it’s kind of like a beta test of the SDK and then simultaneously kind of a beta test of our hardware. This has allowed us to check, does anybody have any problems with the crank? You know, we’re going to manufacture a lot of these and send them out. So we really gotta make sure that they’re good.”",
5509,350.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“And because we had a very limited number of units to give out, versus the amount of interest there was from developers, there are only two hundred to three hundred developers in the Preview right now,” adds Arisa. “We plan on expanding and releasing the SDK publicly at some point in the future, but we’re wanting to kind of make sure that we can provide the sort of support that developers need and the documentation necessary before we do so.”",
5510,351.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“The Developer Preview kind of solved both birds with one stone. You don’t solve a bird with a stone! I just don’t want to talk about killing birds,” laughs Cabel. “Yeah, it was a twofer. It was actually tremendously useful, and the best part about the Developer Preview for me was watching people go from zero to, like, something in a really short period of time, which told me that we are kind of on the right track.”",
5511,352.0,"""Chrono Regular""",There are tons of developers who have been making really cool stuff. So: what about a Season Two?,
5512,353.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“If we do a Season Two,” says Cabel, “we will have that audience that already has Playdates sitting on their desk.

5515,356.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“All of the quirks of Playdate, I think, helped tremendously in attracting developers to want to make something for Playdate,” says Cabel. “If Playdate had a full-color OLED screen and a powerful 3D chip, it would take a very long time for one person to say, ‘Yeah, I’ll make a game for that.’ By going in the opposite direction of where gaming has gone lately, we return to a scale in which one person, two people, three people can make an awesome, entertaining, you know, lengthy, meaningful title, and the constraints enable that.”",

So you’re like, ‘Whoa, I can’t—how did that happen!?’ Like, you see this cool animation that’s really super smooth.”",
5519,360.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“I think a lot of it comes from the choice of that particular screen,” says Steven. “You kind of almost don’t get it until you see it in person. ‘Cause it’s extremely sharp, especially under bright light. You know, it gets better the more light is shining on it, unlike most displays you have today. It’s one of those kinds of things where it’s kind of an artificial constraint you can put on someone like a game designer and say, ‘What can you do with this limitation?’ You know, how can you be creative in this box? And I think people have come up with some really cool ideas.”",
5520,361.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“I love the black and white, 400 by 240 pixel Playdate screen. I kind of like don’t want to design in anything else anymore,” says Neven. “It is so freeing for me, personally, to not think about the color and not think too much about, like, even things like line weight and whatnot. I like to think that when I’m going to draw something in pixel art, there’s like one way to do it. It’s like, you have to draw an arrow at 16 by 16 pixels. And it’s like, well, there’s only one way to do it. Of course, that’s completely false. You know, if you asked 20 different pixel artists to draw it out you will get 20 different arrows. There’s different kinds of flavors to give to art, even when it’s that small and that simple.”",
5521,362.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“A lot of the constraints that breed creativity is what I’m working on in games, the actual physical constraints of the device, you know, having a black and white screen, being small, and all that kind of stuff,” says Dan. “But, yeah, it definitely goes all the way down the stack to having to get creative with solutions, to make sure that you’re not overtaxing the hardware.”",
5522,363.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“You have things like battery power that you needed to consider,” says Marc. “You know, you want somebody to be able to play their Playdate for hours on end and not have to recharge it every 30 minutes.

Just sort of ensuring that absolutely anybody who wants to play Playdate will have the best chance that they can.”",
5526,367.0,"""Chrono Regular""","And since every Playdate device is also a developer unit, why not open up game development to people who don’t code?

5527,368.0,"""Chrono Regular""",So developer Shaun Inman has been building a web-based application called Playdate Pulp for non-programmers (like me!) It’s inspired by development environments like Adam LeDeux’s Bitsy. Neven did the interface design.,
5528,369.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“So we want to make it really easy to make games for Playdate. Game development can only be so easy if you’ve never done any game programming before. There’s always a lot of setting up of just, like, tools and learning the basics of how programming works and then putting pixels on screen and then learning about, you know, how to solve different problems, and physics and math and whatnot. And I think anyone can get there! With enough time and enough effort, they can learn that.”",

5530,371.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“But it’s also sometimes nice to then, give people a way to go from sort of zero to a game in a super short amount of time,” Neven continues. “And I really want this to have an answer for that. How can somebody who has never made a game before, but they really have a story to tell or an idea for a game. How can they make a game quickly? And so we came up with something we call “Playdate Pulp.” Pulp is a web-based tool for making adventure story-based games, where you’re like a character who’s walking around this world that you design, encountering other characters, finding stuff, picking up stuff, and sort of, exploring the world and running through the story of it.”",
5531,372.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“Pulp is cool because it opens the doors for so many people that don’t know how to program and they don’t normally do game development,” says Arisa. “And so, allowing creative people to be able to make cool games, without the knowledge of complex programming languages.”",
5532,373.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“Pulp is limited in scope—there are definitely types of games that Pulp was not really designed for,” admits Neven. “You’re not gonna make, like, a super fast, real-time shooter game in Pulp, just because it’s not what we made it for. But you can make a classic game where you’re, like, exploring a village or some dungeons or a house or something like that. Pulp is something you can use without ever writing a line of code. You can basically draw your art in it. You can lay out these like rooms or environments. You can put down characters, draw those, you can write what dialogue they say. All of that can be done without any code. However, if you’re interested in learning a little bit of scripting code, Pulp also supports something called Pulp Script, where you can have those simple programming solutions. Like if my character has a sword, then they can defeat the dragon at the end, and so on. It really is not very demanding in terms of the hardware that you run it on. The game that you’re working on is saved to your account, on our servers. So you can just come back to it another time, or, you know, another computer and pick up where you left off. And, when you’re done with this game, you can just download a .pdx file— that’s the executable game file for a Playdate—connect your Playdate via USB, and just move this file over. And you’ve got your game made in Pulp, in a web browser, playing on your Playdate. You can send this file to your friends and they can play it on their Playdates. So, in that sense, you can go from, you know, in front of a web browser on your computer to playing a game on your Playdate in minutes. I don’t know if there’s another thing like this for, you know, handheld consoles out there. But to me it’s really cool that you can jump that quickly from an idea, to drawing your art, writing your dialogue or whatever, and then playing a game on your own Playdate.”",
5533,374.0,"""Chrono Regular""","Stepping back a bit, it’s really wild to think that Panic has made not only this handheld gaming device that’s 100% custom, but also developed its operating system from scratch, developed a full SDK that third-party developers have been using for a few years now, plus this entire web-based development environment where anyone can make their own Playdate games that will then run on any Playdate device. It just seems like a lot. Of course, there’s more.",
5534,375.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“We knew that people would want some way to protect their Playdate, and also to kind of make it a little more fashion-y,” says Neven. “So, we started thinking about some sort of a protective cover for it. Now the Playdate has the crank on the side. It has buttons on pretty much all surfaces, you know, and like the front on the right side, on the top, you have ports on the bottom. So we didn’t think that like a kind of a case that fully encloses it would really work well. We were thinking about other ideas. And so we were thinking about the axes along which you can put some sort of protective layer without, you know, blocking the crank or anything. And then,we started thinking about basically like about like a book jacket, you know? So the way that this Playdate cover works is, imagine sort of like a book. Turn it sideways so that it closes top to bottom. It clicks onto the back of the Playdate. It clicks magnetically, by the way, in these like, corner screw holes on the Playdate. And then it sort of folds over the top and it then closes it, you know, from the back to the front, kind of like a book closing. It also makes it look kind of like an ice cream sandwich where you have these two layers of the soft, cushy plastic of the cover around the Playdate. The cover is purple. The Playdate is yellow. It’s a really cool color combo. So it does protect it, because it protects the screen, it covers the buttons. It’ll protect it from getting, you know, bumped in your bag. But it also makes it look like a tiny little hardcover book that you can put on your shelf.”",
5535,376.0,"""Chrono Regular""","The cover is super adorable. And then, of course, there’s the Playdate stereo dock.",
5536,377.0,"""Chrono Regular""","“So, the Playdate stereo dock is our first major accessory for the Playdate,” says Greg. “The idea came from Teenage Engineering. They sent us a concept drawing of this thing. It just looked incredibly cool. It made Playdate, look like a little TV. And we immediately fell in love with it. It is a little yellow cube that sits on your desk, and you can mount the Playdate on the front of it. It’s got a magnetic front, so it snaps right onto it.”",

So the idea was that if you want a slightly thicker Playdate on the go, you can snap on the speaker. And then if you want a very thick Playdate/one that also can sit on your desk, you can also snap on a battery pack. You can see that in the design today, where we kept the seam between the two units. ‘Cause we thought it looked kind of visually interesting. But in getting into the realities of that point, that was a lot going on at once. With the Playdate stereo dock, it was difficult to engineer something that was all of these separate pieces. And so at some point we said, okay, let’s make this one piece. And then we said, and well, let’s probably remove the battery because we don’t need that anymore because it’s now going to be just sitting on the desk. The Playdate stereo dock is awesome, because it provides a cool home for the Playdate. That’s my favorite thing about it.

Flickr has built a product loved by millions of photographers for nearly two decades and we have some real history in our code base. You can imagine the amount of work it takes to maintain the stability of our large, complex, public-facing API—which impacts not just customers who use our API, but our own web, mobile, and desktop clients.",
5871,712.0,"Arial, sans-serif","The difficulty of wrangling a legacy code base is what led us to be interested in Akita, an observability company going after the dream of “one-click” observability. Akita’s first product passively watches API traffic using packet capture (PCAP) to provide automated API monitoring, automatically infer the structure of API endpoints, and automatically detect potential issues and breaking changes. Akita’s goal is to make it possible for organizations like ours, with our hundreds of thousands of lines of legacy code, to understand system behavior in order to move quickly.",

5873,714.0,"Arial, sans-serif","First, let me give some context on high-level responsibilities of backend engineering at Flickr. Since moving Flickr into the cloud two years ago we’ve had more time to focus on modernizing our services and improving our developer experience. This puts us in a much better position to build new features than before—but first, we need to streamline how we get things done, which is not nearly as simple as it sounds.",
5874,715.0,"Arial, sans-serif","Today, we serve up around a billion photos daily from millions of photographers. Nearly every Flickr API request executes legacy code in some way—code that is less tested, less documented, and sometimes dangerous to mess with. A great deal of care has to be taken to avoid disruptions. And when new features need to interact with older features, this can get complex fast! On top of all that, we need to find ways to help our small but mighty team focus their limited time and attention while navigating the old and the new, without the luxury of handing this problem over to an internal tools team.",
5875,716.0,"Arial, sans-serif","Our difficulty getting a handle on our legacy systems led us to become excited about using Akita for easy observability. Akita promised to tell us about our API interactions and potential issues with the API, all by passively watching API traffic. But there was, as I mentioned, a catch: Akita works only for REST APIs right now, and our API is… RESTish. Most notably, we never adopted the REST convention of using distinct URL paths for each service endpoint, and we rely heavily on passing parameters through the query string, or form-encoded in POSTs. This situation has historically made it hard for us to use other API tools as well.",
5876,717.0,"Arial, sans-serif","Thankfully our PHP request handlers are plug and play so I quickly whipped up a new proof-of-concept handler showing that we could start getting visibility into our API endpoints and their behavior using Akita. This gave me the ability to generate Akita traces using curl and the Akita command line interface (CLI) tool out of the box, but only within my local dev environment.",
5877,718.0,"Arial, sans-serif",,
5878,719.0,"Arial, sans-serif","Right away I spotted some things to improve, and more ideas came that afternoon. I wanted to put our `api_key` parameter into an Authorization header, and remove the `method` parameter since I’d used it in a fake service path. Also, our API returns a 200 HTTP Status on errors, including an element `stat` indicating failure. I wanted those to be HTTP 400s.",
5879,720.0,"Arial, sans-serif","But I had a conundrum: Akita works best when observing production traffic. Real, production API requests at production load will really fill in the nooks and crannies of our API models. My progress showed it would be so worth it to go further, so I met with the Akita team and discussed using their Go-based plugin system to transform our live requests into a desirable format based on my proof-of-concept. It turns out that most of Akita’s tooling is open source and I could work on the plugin myself! This turned out to be the key to making Akita work with our RESTish format.",
5880,721.0,"Arial, sans-serif",Exciting news! I just needed to turn my prototype into something that I could run with the Akita agent every time.,
5881,722.0,"Arial, sans-serif","The Akita CLI has a mechanism for dynamically loading plugins, which can operate on the captured and parsed data before it is sent to the Akita cloud. My transformations of the API format into a more REST-like format could be packaged that way.",
5882,723.0,"Arial, sans-serif","I soon discovered that I was the first person to try building a third-party plugin. Akita told me that they used the plugin architecture internally to package a non-open-source plugin that infers data formats, but that is compiled into the client. ",

5885,726.0,"Arial, sans-serif","I worked around this by compiling the open-source version of the Akita CLI myself and pointing the plugin build at the exact same version of the source code. An engineer at Akita reported the same problem and concluded that the plugin needed to be built at the same time as the program that will use it. Go’s idiosyncratic linking conventions seem to make it virtually impossible for such an external plugin to satisfy its dependencies against multiple versions of the base binary. Later, we learned the following from Russ Cox, confirming that our decision to abandon the external plugin approach was wise:",

5888,729.0,"Arial, sans-serif","To make this process repeatable, we adopted a hybrid approach where I added the Flickr-specific transformations of the API as a plugin in a newly created Akita open source repository. (You can check out the code here!) Akita will compile that plugin in all their future CLI builds so there would be no problem with dynamic loading. I can enable the plugin for my traces with a command-line flag and use the most recent version of the CLI without recompiling my plugin to match. This is the same way Akita incorporates modules for type inference. Other users can incorporate contributions in a similar way.",
5889,730.0,"Arial, sans-serif","Now that we have the plugin written, we’re moving toward integration with our production environment. Here’s an example of what we’re able to understand with Akita.

Stay tuned for updates!",
5892,733.0,"Arial, sans-serif","I see our partnership with Akita as a key part of the beginning of our effort to innovate how to move fast with a legacy system. This problem is not unique to us: Facebook has built multiple type systems for multiple different dynamically typed languages to deal with it! But the fact that we can’t spin off dedicated teams to write compilers for PHP places its own set of constraints. And there are many companies that are in a similar boat: small or medium sized engineering teams of passionate, driven, smart people working on products they love and want you, their customer, to love, too.",
5893,734.0,"Arial, sans-serif","I love working on these sorts of problems because they are among the hardest to solve.

5938,779.0,"Arial, sans-serif","To further that effort, today we are introducing similarity search on Flickr.

5939,780.0,"Arial, sans-serif","In many ways, photo search is very different from traditional web or text search. First, the goal of web search is usually to satisfy a particular information need, while with photo search the goal is often one of discovery; as such, it should be delightful as well as functional. We have taken this to heart throughout Flickr. For instance, our color search feature, which allows filtering by color scheme, and our style filters, which allow filtering by styles such as “minimalist” or “patterns,” encourage exploration. Second, in traditional web search, the goal is usually to match documents to a set of keywords in the query. That is, the query is in the same modality—text—as the documents being searched. Photo search usually matches across modalities: text to image. Text querying is a necessary feature of a photo search engine, but, as the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. And beyond saving people the effort of so much typing, many visual concepts genuinely defy accurate description. Now, we’re giving our community a way to easily explore those visual concepts with the “…” button, a feature we call the similarity pivot.",

5947,788.0,"Arial, sans-serif","What notion of similarity is best suited for a site like Flickr? Ideally, we’d like to be able to capture multiple types of similarity, but we decided early on that semantic similarity—similarity based on the semantic content of the photos—was vital to facilitate discovery on Flickr. This requires a deep understanding of image content for which we employ deep neural networks.",
5948,789.0,"Arial, sans-serif","We have been using deep neural networks at Flickr for a while for various tasks such as object recognition, NSFW prediction, and even prediction of aesthetic quality. For these tasks, we train a neural network to map the raw pixels of a photo into a set of relevant tags, as illustrated below.",
5949,790.0,"Arial, sans-serif",,
5950,791.0,"Arial, sans-serif","Internally, the neural network accomplishes this mapping incrementally by applying a series of transformations to the image, which can be thought of as a vector of numbers corresponding to the pixel intensities. Each transformation in the series produces another vector, which is in turn the input to the next transformation, until finally we have a vector that we specifically constrain to be a list of probabilities for each class we are trying to recognize in the image. To be able to go from raw pixels to a semantic label like “hot air balloon,” the network discards lots of information about the image, including information about  appearance, such as the color of the balloon, its relative position in the sky, etc. Instead, we can extract an internal vector in the network before the final output.",
5951,792.0,"Arial, sans-serif",,
5952,793.0,"Arial, sans-serif","For common neural network architectures, this vector—which we call a “feature vector”—has many hundreds or thousands of dimensions. We can’t necessarily say with certainty that any one of these dimensions means something in particular as we could at the final network output, whose dimensions correspond to tag probabilities. But these vectors have an important property: when you compute the Euclidean distance between these vectors, images containing similar content will tend to have feature vectors closer together than images containing dissimilar content. You can think of this as a way that the network has learned to organize information present in the image so that it can output the required class prediction. This is exactly what we are looking for: Euclidian distance in this high-dimensional feature space is a measure of semantic similarity. The graphic below illustrates this idea: points in the neighborhood around the query image are semantically similar to the query image, whereas points in neighborhoods further away are not.",
5953,794.0,"Arial, sans-serif",,
5954,795.0,"Arial, sans-serif","This measure of similarity is not perfect and cannot capture all possible notions of similarity—it will be constrained by the particular task the network was trained to perform, i.e., scene recognition. However, it is effective for our purposes, and, importantly, it contains information beyond merely the semantic content of the image, such as appearance, composition, and texture. Most importantly, it gives us a simple algorithm for finding visually similar photos: compute the distance in the feature space of a query image to each index image and return the images with lowest distance. Of course, there is much more work to do to make this idea work for billions of images.",
5955,796.0,"Arial, sans-serif","With an index as large as Flickr’s, computing distances exhaustively for each query is intractable. Additionally, storing a high-dimensional floating point feature vector for each of billions of images takes a large amount of disk space and poses even more difficulty if these features need to be in memory for fast ranking. To solve these two issues, we adopt a state-of-the-art approximate nearest neighbor algorithm called Locally Optimized Product Quantization (LOPQ).",
5956,797.0,"Arial, sans-serif","To understand LOPQ, it is useful to first look at a simple strategy. Rather than ranking all vectors in the index, we can first filter a set of good candidates and only do expensive distance computations on them. For example, we can use an algorithm like k-means to cluster our index vectors, find the cluster to which each vector is assigned, and index the corresponding cluster id for each vector. At query time, we find the cluster that the query vector is assigned to and fetch the items that belong to the same cluster from the index. We can even expand this set if we like by fetching items from the next nearest cluster.",
5957,798.0,"Arial, sans-serif","This idea will take us far, but not far enough for a billions-scale index. For example, with 1 billion photos, we need 1 million clusters so that each cluster contains an average of 1000 photos. At query time, we will have to compute the distance from the query to each of these 1 million cluster centroids in order to find the nearest clusters. This is quite a lot. We can do better, however, if we instead split our vectors in half by dimension and cluster each half separately. In this scheme, each vector will be assigned to a pair of cluster ids, one for each half of the vector. If we choose k = 1000 to cluster both halves, we have k2= 1000 * 1000 = 1e6 possible pairs. In other words, by clustering each half separately and assigning each item a pair of cluster ids, we can get the same granularity of partitioning (1 million clusters total) with only 2 * 1000 distance computations with half the number of dimensions for a total computational savings of 1000x. Conversely, for the same computational cost, we gain a factor of k more partitions of the data space, providing a much finer-grained index.",
5958,799.0,"Arial, sans-serif","This idea of splitting vectors into subvectors and clustering each split separately is called product quantization. When we use this idea to index a dataset it is called the inverted multi-index, and it forms the basis for fast candidate retrieval in our similarity index. Typically the distribution of points over the clusters in a multi-index will be unbalanced as compared to a standard k-means index, but this unbalance is a fair trade for the much higher resolution partitioning that it buys us. In fact, a multi-index will only be balanced across clusters if the two halves of the vectors are perfectly statistically independent. This is not the case in most real world data, but some heuristic preprocessing—like PCA-ing and permuting the dimensions so that the cumulative per-dimension variance is approximately balanced between the halves—helps in many cases. And just like the simple k-means index, there is a fast algorithm for finding a ranked list of clusters to a query if we need to expand the candidate set.",
5959,800.0,"Arial, sans-serif","After we have a set of candidates, we must rank them. We could store the full vector in the index and use it to compute the distance for each candidate item, but this would incur a large memory overhead (for example, 256 dimensional vectors of 4 byte floats would require 1Tb for 1 billion photos) as well as a computational overhead. LOPQ solves these issues by performing another product quantization, this time on the residuals of the data. The residual of a point is the difference vector between the point and its closest cluster centroid. Given a residual vector and the cluster indexes along with the corresponding centroids, we have enough information to reproduce the original vector exactly. Instead of storing the residuals, LOPQ product quantizes the residuals, usually with a higher number of splits, and stores only the cluster indexes in the index. For example, if we split the vector into 8 splits and each split is clustered with 256 centroids, we can store the compressed vector with only 8 bytes regardless of the number of dimensions to start (though certainly a higher number of dimensions will result in higher approximation error). With this lossy representation we can produce a reconstruction of a vector from the 8 byte codes: we simply take each quantization code, look up the corresponding centroid, and concatenate these 8 centroids together to produce a reconstruction. Likewise, we can approximate the distance from the query to an index vector by computing the distance between the query and the reconstruction. We can do this computation quickly for many candidate points by computing the squared difference of each split of the query to all of the centroids for that split. After computing this table, we can compute the squared difference for an index point by looking up the precomputed squared difference for each of the 8 indexes and summing them together to get the total squared difference. This caching trick allows us to quickly rank many candidates without resorting to distance computations in the original vector space.",
5960,801.0,"Arial, sans-serif","LOPQ adds one final detail: for each cluster in the multi-index, LOPQ fits a local rotation to the residuals of the points that fall in that cluster. This rotation is simply a PCA that aligns the major directions of variation in the data to the axes followed by a permutation to heuristically balance the variance across the splits of the product quantization. Note that this is the exact preprocessing step that is usually performed at the top-level multi-index. It tends to make the approximate distance computations more accurate by mitigating errors introduced by assuming that each split of the vector in the production quantization is statistically independent from other splits. Additionally, since a rotation is fit for each cluster, they serve to fit the local data distribution better.",
5961,802.0,"Arial, sans-serif","Below is a diagram from the LOPQ paper that illustrates the core ideas of LOPQ. K-means (a) is very effective at allocating cluster centroids, illustrated as red points, that target the distribution of the data, but it has other drawbacks at scale as discussed earlier. In the 2d example shown, we can imagine product quantizing the space with 2 splits, each with 1 dimension. Product Quantization (b) clusters each dimension independently and cluster centroids are specified by pairs of cluster indexes, one for each split. This is effectively a grid over the space. Since the splits are treated as if they were statistically independent, we will, unfortunately, get many clusters that are “wasted” by not targeting the data distribution. We can improve on this situation by rotating the data such that the main dimensions of variation are axis-aligned. This version, called Optimized Product Quantization (c), does a better job of making sure each centroid is useful. LOPQ (d) extends this idea by first coarsely clustering the data and then doing a separate instance of OPQ for each cluster, allowing highly targeted centroids while still reaping the benefits of product quantization in terms of scalability.",

5975,816.0,"Arial, sans-serif","As we dug into the problem, we looked at our storage systems in detail. We discovered that our settings were based on assumptions about high write and delete loads that didn’t hold. Our storage is pretty static. Users only rarely delete or change images once uploaded. We also had two distinct areas of just-in-case space. 5% of our storage was reserved space for snapshots, useful for undoing accidental deletes or writes, and 8.5% was held free in reserve. This resulted in about 13% of our storage going unused. Trade lore states that disks should remain 10% free to avoid performance degradation, but we found 5% to be sufficient for our workload. So we combined our our two just-in-case areas into one and reduced our free space threshold to that level. This was our simplest approach to the problem (by far), but it resulted in a large gain. With a couple simple configuration changes, we freed up more than 8% of our storage.",

5977,818.0,"Arial, sans-serif","In our earlier posts, we have described dynamic generation of thumbnail sizes and perceptual compression. Combining the two approaches decreased thumbnail storage requirements by 65%, though we hadn’t applied these techniques to many of our images uploaded prior to 2014.

5978,819.0,"Arial, sans-serif","Because we were concerned that further rollout of dynamic thumbnail generation would place a heavy load on our resizing infrastructure, we targeted only thumbnails from less-popular images for deletes. Using this approach, we were able to handle our complete resize load with just four GPUs. The process put a heavy load on our storage systems; to minimize the impact we randomized our operations across volumes. The entire process took about four months, resulting in even more significant gains than our storage threshold adjustments.",
5979,820.0,"Arial, sans-serif",Decreasing the number of thumbnail sizes,
5980,821.0,"Arial, sans-serif","Flickr has had a long-standing commitment to keeping uploaded images byte-for-byte intact. This has placed a floor on how much storage reduction we can do, but there are tools that can losslessly compress JPG images. Two well-known options are PackJPG and Lepton, from Dropbox. These tools work by decoding the JPG, then very carefully compressing it using a more efficient approach. This typically shrinks a JPG by about 22%. At Flickr’s scale, this is significant. The downside is that these re-compressors use a lot of CPU. PackJPG compresses at about 2MB/s on a single core, or about fifteen core-years for a single petabyte worth of JPGs. Lepton uses multiple cores and, at 15MB/s, is much faster than packJPG, but uses roughly the same amount of CPU time.",
5981,822.0,"Arial, sans-serif","This CPU requirement also complicated on-demand serving. If we recompressed all the images on Flickr, we would need potentially thousands of cores to handle our decompress load. We considered putting some restrictions on access to compressed images, such as requiring users to login to access original images, but ultimately found that if we targeted only rarely accessed private images, decompressions would occur only infrequently. Additionally, restricting the maximum size of images we compressed limited our CPU time per decompress. We rolled this out as a component of our existing serving stack without requiring any additional CPUs, and with only minor impact to user experience.",

We could “freeze” these images, dropping their thumbnails and recreate them when the dormant user returns. This “thaw” process would take under thirty seconds for a typical account. Additionally, for photos that are private (but not dormant), we could go to a single uncompressed copy of each thumbnail, storing a compressed copy in a second datacenter that would be decompressed as needed.",
5986,827.0,"Arial, sans-serif","We might not even need two copies of each dormant original image available on disk. We’ve pencilled out a model where we place one copy on a slower, but underutilized, tape-based system while leaving the other on disk. This would decrease availability during an outage, but as these images belong to dormant users, the effect would be minimal and users would still see their thumbnails. The delicate piece here is the placement of data, as seeks on tape systems are prohibitively slow. Depending on the details of what constitutes a “dormant” photo these techniques could comfortably reduce storage used by over 25%.",
5987,828.0,"Arial, sans-serif","We’ve also looked into de-duplication, but we found our duplicate rate is in the 3% range.

Peter Klauer died in 1919 and the plates remained in storage—occasionally thumbed through by the curious, but mostly forgotten—for 60 years. In the 1970s the plates were pulled out of storage and at least two sets of contact prints were made. In the 1980s, William Klauer, Peter’s grandson, donated a set of contact prints (numbering 443) to the Center for Dubuque History at Loras College, and later 330 of the 8.5 x 6.5 glass plates—all that then remained—were donated as well.

They seemed richer than many of the contemporary prints I made every day. So the idea of making enlargements of the plates in the Klauer Collection intrigued me. I also noted the 1912 date and mentioned in an offhand way to a few people, including Mike Gibson at the Center for Dubuque History, that it would be interesting to do another shoot in 2012.

If he was still with us here in the land of the living, today would’ve been my Dad’s 78th Birthday. This photo, taken at the party after Harley’s baptism, perfectly sums up the dynamic of our relationship: we looked at stuff together in silence. Whether it was a George Carlin album as it spun on a record player or CARLIN AT CARNEGIE as it took over the TV in the early days of HBO, the time my Father and I spent together was always about watching stuff. And mostly, that stuff was movies.",

In doing this, a Father was subtly teaching his butterball, silly-hearted youngest child that everything in life came secondary to a good movie – including my education and my God.",
6186,1027.0,"Verdana, Tahoma, Georgia, Geneva, Arial","The first time the Old Man decided to pull me out of school early to see a flick, my Mom told me to tell the Sisters that I was missing Religion class because a Great Aunt had died and we were rushing to a last minute funeral – not that my Dad wanted to see RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK for cheap mid-week. The movie rocked, of course – not just because it was Lucas and Spielberg at their best, but also because it was transgressive to be in the cinema at all when I was supposed to be learning about Christ. And my Father was not only not punishing me for lying to a grown-up, he was complicit as well! The next day, I tried to explain to my best friend Ernie O’Donnell two very controversial points I’d learned while studying a mid-afternoon movie instead of the Bible: 1) My Dad was cool, and 2) Indiana Jones was like an American James Bond.",
6187,1028.0,"Verdana, Tahoma, Georgia, Geneva, Arial","After we got away with movie matinee hooky, Pop decided that was gonna be our “thing”: every week, he’d sign me out of school early and we’d go to the movies. I was the third of his three kids, disinterested in country music (his passion) and less interested in sports (his pastime). But I LOVED television. I LOVED the movies. And this was the common ground upon which my Dad and I would build the foundation of our relationship: watching entertainment together, generally in silence.",

Again, my Mom instructs me to tell the Sisters the family is rushing to a funeral for a fallen great aunt. The Principal, Sister Gloria Louise, seems to buy it.

We didn’t really talk after the movies, but the old man always had plenty to express after a Bond flick – usually regarding Roger Moore being an okay 007, but Sean Connery being his favorite. And I’d listen with great attention, like it mattered – because it was really something when the Old Man has something to say.",
6190,1031.0,"Verdana, Tahoma, Georgia, Geneva, Arial","See, Dad didn’t really ever talk that much. Not that he didn’t have anything on his mind: he was just self conscious as a motherfucker (which he, in fact, literally was). Dad had been born with a hair lip and a cleft palate, so his whole life, he tried to keep his mouth shut so as not to gross everybody out – even his kids. Can you imagine? The Father of the guy who does 69 different podcasts a day was pretty tight-lipped. It’s likely the reason I talk so much: there must be some subconscious desire to say all the stuff my Dad was too trapped inside himself to express.",

But to be fair, I enjoyed every movie I ever saw with my Father. Some were good, some weren’t as good, but none of them were ever a waste of our time – time we spent together. And as much as I’d always been a movie brat, that month was where my lifelong love affair with cinema began in earnest. Movies were so revered in my family, I was encouraged to lie (a sin!) to my teachers so I could circumvent the system and play hooky at the picture show. With an adult who was supposed to have known better, no less.",

Some were good, some weren’t, but none of them were ever a waste of my time. Because each one is a mini-monument to the man who made me. JERSEY GIRL was the last of my flicks he got to see, and while some may snark that’s what probably killed him, I know better: I was there when he watched the flick the first time. I saw him cry – and it wasn’t because he was thinking “My kid just ruined his career…” The man of few words told me EXACTLY what was on his mind after the movie ended.",

6886,1727.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","Joe Biden has been so good at serving in office, he frankly sucked at doing what you have to do to run for office in a crowded field, and get noticed doing it.

6887,1728.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","This time, he was having a really hard time breaking through the primary process with so many louder voices.

6888,1729.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","Joe Biden has one last chance to make it to the show. By being the presumptive candidate, he no longer had to be the loudest candidate in the room. People were going to listen to this speech. So Thursday night he delivered the best speech of his life, and his party delivered the most powerful supporting program any party has every produced for its candidate. They produced a hit.",
6889,1730.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","Amazingly, this all happened against the backdrop of a pandemic that forced the conventions of both parties away from the time-honored political rally — the single weapon in Donald Trump’s arsenal. The pressure on the Democrats and Joe Biden to match the entertainment value of a Trump romp looked nearly impossible to overcome.",
6890,1731.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","But what he did — and they did — was historic. It will go down as one of the greatest political pitches in our Democracy’s history. He and his team used the medium to tell the most powerful political story I have ever seen in 50 years as a journalist and political junkie. If anything, they proved that political parties have been doing it all wrong over the past 30 or 40 years. In the past they spent their time trying to give the public a glimpse of a traditional 4-day convention where most of the action was actually behind closed doors. So it became a contest of which party could put on the most entertaining show. Even the best journalists look silly being jostled among packed in delegates waving signs.",
6891,1732.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","This time, the parties had to find a way to make the message interesting. And they did it perfectly, in a way befitting a broadcast audience. Speeches were much shorter and tighter…no longer punctuated by hoots and hollers of drunk delegates dressed in funny clothes who clapped for 5 minutes out of every 10 just so they could be seen on the air. The use of regular people, speaking from home, enabled the Democrats to show how much Biden helped so many different people through his amazing hard-earned empathy and ability to listen. The usually boring, long, roll call instead brought us committed, serious people from where they lived, to show just how diverse these people really are and how different the places are that they come from.",
6892,1733.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","The human stories of people who defined the candidate, were done in wonderful, powerfully told interviews and videos that made their points, well produced and much more valuable than a wave from the upper deck.",
6893,1734.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","He was able to convince people, through his speech and the speeches of those before him, that it might actually be possible to bring this country back to a time when people will work together to solve problems and can even, perhaps, have some real hope. And why he was uniquely qualified to do that.",
6894,1735.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","His speech was the perfect topping to 4 days of telling people the situation they are now in, and that “it didn’t have to be this way”.",
6895,1736.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","Some people, usually humble and caring people, have a hard time standing out in a crowd, partly because they spend a lot more time listening to others and caring about them. Joe Biden has always been one of those people. And it’s one reason the only way he got to be Vice President was because he ran on the coattails of a great orator.

6906,1747.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","This week we lost one of the giants of journalism. Pete Hamill worked at five different New York Newspapers as a columnist and at one point was even the editor of the New York Post. Growing up around New York he was one of main reasons I fell in love with journalism at a young age in the 60s. He and the his close pal Jimmy Breslin romanticised every corner of The city. When I finally got to my first full time job as a reporter at the San Francisco Examiner in 1974, the first thing I did was find a way to get Hamill to write for us. How that happened, and how the experiment ended, was a story I will never forget.",
6907,1748.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","I have two wonderful anecdotes about my time with Pete Hamill in the mid 70’s. They go back to my first job in the business, when I went to San Francisco to work at the Examiner as a reporter and Asst to the Editor, right out of grad school (I had gone to Harvard Business School after graduating from the Newhouse School at Syracuse). I was hired directly by Randolph Hearst, then publisher and chairman of the Hearst Corp.",
6908,1749.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","When I got there in 1974 one of my first friends was Will Hearst III (now chairman). We were both about 25 and he was apprenticing at his grandfather’s first newspaper and like me had a mix of entry level journalism and a taste of management training. Randy Hearst really wanted his nephew, Will, to liven up the paper and was hiring a lot of scrappy young reporters to help.",
6909,1750.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","Anyway, I had this idea that we could hire my idol Pete Hamill to write for us from NYC. He was my favorite New York Post columnist who I had read growing up in NYC. Pete’s politics were very liberal and would be a great contract to the existing Hearst lineup of very conservative columnists, and I thought, quite attractive to the very liberal San Francisco audience. He had just quit the NY Post, which was owned and run by Dorothy Schiff in those days, because she wouldn’t pay him more than $300 a week.",
6910,1751.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif",So I suggested it to Will and he told me to call Pete and see if he would do it.,

6924,1765.0,"Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif","Just thinking about him makes me nostalgic for my days growing up in the New Jersey suburbs of New York. I was a huge fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers and with Pete’s love affair with all things Brooklyn, he owned me. I read every word he wrote, as soon as I could.
